# ArduinoClock
An Arduino clock using a 16 by 2 LCD and an RTC module. 

The plan is to replace the Arduino UNO with an ATtiny85 and have buttons etc to adjust the date and time, turn on/off the backlight etc. 

I might even make it sleep between updates and have the Watchdog wake up every second to update the LCD. ;)
